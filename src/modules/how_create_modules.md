# How create your own modules

First you need to go into the folder of the module you want to make.
Create a new folder in that module folder and make a scene with the same name.
To make things easier you could first duplicate the default folder and 
rename the above mentioned things.

When you are done creating your module, go to export, resources and 
select the option to only export selected scenes. 
**Be certain to export as a PCK file!**
