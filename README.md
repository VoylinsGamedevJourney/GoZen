# GoZen
*The Minimalist Video Editor*

## Where see the progress

I've made a page for displaying the progress for this video editor which you can find on [this link to the Notion board!](https://voylin.notion.site/voylin/GoZen-a998dc9479c84a8ea35e330d45813982)

## Meaning of GoZen 

I named the editor GoZen, Go comes from Godot and Zen from ... zen. I want this editor to be very useful, but not be too complex to the end user so they can edit videos whilst being zen. Honestly, I had a very good reason to use zen in the name but I completely forgot as I only wrote down the name and not how I came up with it. ^^"

（午前）Gozen also means morning in Japanese, so the logo represents a rising sun. The logo and look of the editor is all still a work in progress!

## Why create a video editor with Godot?

I have talked about this in [my first video of this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps0yQOJCYi0) so I don't want to talk too much more about the reason other than to say: Godot is capable of many things, it gives me a good UI framework and tons of possibilities for people to create their own modules and plugins for the editor and the 3D/2D capabilities save me some work to implement more complexs features.

### How about blender??

I don't know why people keep asking this, YES I HAVE USED BLENDER!! I have used so many video editors on Linux and they all have problems or are too complex to use for simple projects. I want to edit videos without crashes the whole time (KdenLive), I want an editor that accepts my video files (Davinci Resolve), I want an editor which is not overly complex to learn and get into (Blender), ...

I'm sorry for the people who feel offended that I don't like their video editor choice but my vision of a video editor is different than yours I guess. I want a simple, yet powerful video editor.

## This video editor will be bad

May be bad to say that this video editor will be bad, but I want to only make the basic functionalities of this editor and let other people improve upon it by contributing or by making their own modules. Everything is a module, the startup screen, file explorer, timeline, ... Everything can be switched out and replaced. 

I create the interfaces so people can easily design modules that will work with others (as long as they use the module interface properly).
